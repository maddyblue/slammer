XSDB8.D=WARNING\: Derby (instance {0}) is attempting to boot the database {1} even though Derby (instance {2}) may still be active.  Only one instance of Derby should boot a database at a time. Severe and non-recoverable corruption can result if 2 instances of Derby boot on the same database at the same time.  The db2j.database.forceDatabaseLock\=true property has been set, so the database will not boot until the db.lck is no longer present.  Normally this file is removed when the first instance of Derby to boot on the database exits, but it may be left behind in some shutdowns.  It will be necessary to remove the file by hand in that case.  It is important to verify that no other VM is accessing the database before deleting the db.lck file by hand.
